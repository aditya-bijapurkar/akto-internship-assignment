## Demo

I have used postman to do all the API calling

### 1) api/getUrl

sends the url of the client we are connected to in interact-client

![getUrl](images/get.png)

### 2) api/getInteractions

before sending this API request make some interactions to the interactsh-client in a different terminal

```
    ex: ping 'url'
```

sends a list of all interactions made to the specific link

![getInteractions](images/post.png)

optional parameters which defines a range,
add the start and end timestamp in the body of the POST request
